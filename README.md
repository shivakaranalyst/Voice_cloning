Run the script:
Evaluating Performance
Summarization
Coherence: After obtaining the summary, read through it to ensure it maintains the overall context and essence of the original transcript.

Brevity: The summary should be significantly shorter than the original transcript while retaining the main points.

Completeness: Ensure that all the vital information from the original content is present in the summarized version.

Translation
Accuracy: Compare the translated summary with the original summary. It should convey the same message, even if the wording differs.

Grammaticality: Ensure that the translated text reads naturally in the target language and adheres to its grammar rules.

Text-to-Speech
Audibility: Listen to the generated audio to ensure the speech is clear and audible.

Naturalness: The speech should sound relatively natural and not overly robotic.

General
Runtime: Monitor the time it takes for the script to run from start to finish. Faster execution is generally preferable, but not at the expense of quality.

Error Handling: Observe how the script behaves when encountering issues, like a missing transcript. It should ideally handle such scenarios gracefully, without crashing.
